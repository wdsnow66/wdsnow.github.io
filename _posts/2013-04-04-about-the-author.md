I'm an engineer, starting as an electronics engineer and later as a database designer and user of data analytics applications. I'd like to capture here what I've learned about academic research data workflow. As a Stanford grad, I'll relate this back to resources at my alma mater but our academic insitution will have similar reosources. My website [my personal website](https://stanford.edu/~wdsnow/) has more information on my other projects and contact information.
