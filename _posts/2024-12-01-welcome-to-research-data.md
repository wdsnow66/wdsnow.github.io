## Welcome to Research Data
This site is knowledge sharing based on a decade of work in an academic quantitative research team, including lessons learned, guidelines and resources. The site is intended for other academic Researchers especially in the Stanford ecosystem.

## Lessons Learned
 
A post describing the project, implementation, and lessons learned from a decade of research data workflow and database design in CREDO at Stanford, resulting in a seminal paper on K-12 School Choice. See [CREDO Lessons Learned]({{ site.github.url }}{% post_url 2024-07-01-credo-lessons-learned %})

## Workflow

The reserach data workflow took advantage of best practice, available resources, policy. That is summarized in [Research Data Workflow]({{ site.github.url }}{% post_url 2024-11-01-research-data-workflow %}).

## The Institutional Commitment and Researcher Guidelines

The institution is committed to supporting this best practice as described on this post [Institutional Support]({{ site.github.url }}{% post_url 2024-10-01-institutional-support %}). Based on stated principles, the institution offers  [Guidelines for Researchers]({{ site.github.url }}{% post_url 2024-09-01-guidelines-for-researchers %}) and shares [Resources for Researchers]({{ site.github.url }}{% post_url 2024-08-01-resources-for-researchers %}) from within the institution or the community.
